##The following repo contains the server (which was given as part of the question, as well as the answer, i have also added some API testing scripts). The document related to API bugs and the Tested Postman script collection was sent to the email. 

Pre-Requisites. 
1. There will be a certain node version conflicts when working with the given server and the Playwright framework (Require version =>14.) node version. I recomend to use NVM or first install the Server artfacts, remove the node package and then install the platwright recomended version (version => 14). 

2. Run the following command.
    `npm install`
3. The above code should ideally install all the dependencies to run the test.
4. Code Structure contains 2 section: 
    A. API testing : Have added few API scripts using playwright framework

    B. UI Automation : Contains 3 folders ( PageObjects, Spec, Common )
